# Project Overview

## Introduction
For this project, we will analyse a credit facility dataset, which can be accessed from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset?resource=download. Employing Python coding within Jupyter Notebook, we will construct a machine learning model called Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The main goal of this analysis is to predict the 'loan_status' column assessing the likelihood of a current customer defaulting on their debt payment. 

## Dataset Information

### Data Variables
The dataset consists of different details about customers' financial situations which include their personal information and factors related to loans. These details cover things like demographics, financial status and signs of how reliable they are with loans known as loan grade. These aspects form the basis of our analysis and the process of predicting outcomes . [Dataset](https://github.com/Md-Khid/ANN_Classification_Prediction/blob/main/credit_risk_dataset.csv)

## Data Preparation

In this phase of data processing, we will refine the dataset for analysis by addressing missing values, handling special characters, and encoding variables. Additionally, we will import all necessary modules and libraries for the project and transform categorical variables into category columns for data visualisation purposes.

### Data Pre-processing:

#### Import Python Libraries and Modules for Data Preprocessing, Modelling and Evaluation
```
# Install pip packages if required
#!pip install imblearn
#!pip install tensorflow

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, OneHotEncoder
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix, roc_curve, auc
```

#### Loading and Categorising Loan Status in a Credit Risk Dataset

```
# Load and read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('credit_risk_dataset.csv')

# Map loan_status to categorical values
loan_status_mapping = {0: 'Non-Default', 1: 'Default'}
df['loan_status'] = df['loan_status'].map(loan_status_mapping)

# Display the updated DataFrame
df
```
